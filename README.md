Chrome extension for organizing tabs

## Overview
Sometimes I have way too many tabs open and can't even figure out where anything is anymore because the tabs are so tiny--like I can't even read the site titles anymore! Let's face it--chrome doesn't provide much organization for tabs... Thus, naturally, this app is the tab organizer you need :)

Inspired by [OneTab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall?hl=en) & also [Tabulator](https://github.com/Greduan/chrome-ext-tabulator)
